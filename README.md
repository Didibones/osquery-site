## osquery-site-data

This repo is an extension of the [`facebook/osquery`](https://github.com/facebook/osquery) repository.

It holds the schema generated by `./tools/codegen/genapi.py`. We choose to keep this content in a separate repo to avoid checking in 10K files into the monolithic osquery repo.
